# Algorithm Activities

The solutions to files without a folder can be run using node. 

`node .\FirstRepeat.js`

Output:

`String Entered: Welcome to my home in Mississippi.
The strings 1st duplicate is >> S << at index 24.`

Some of the more recent solutions are in folders and use the chai test library to render unit tests on the associated HTML page. You can view these test.html files to see the test output and that the algorithms output as expected. The actual test functionality is in the test folders.
